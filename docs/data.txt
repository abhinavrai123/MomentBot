log_day is auto-generated based on log_time using SQLite's GENERATED expression.
tags and log_ids are stored as comma-separated strings for now (SQLite doesn't support array types natively).
embedding is a binary BLOB placeholder if you store vector encodings later (or can be base64-encoded string).
All times are assumed to be stored in UTC. Always use datetime.utcnow() in Python.

sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent))
Use the sys.path.append(...) line when running scripts from subfolders like scripts/ or dev/.
It tells Python to treat the root project folder (MomentBot/) as the top of the import path tree.
This makes all relative imports from src/ valid and avoids ModuleNotFoundError.
